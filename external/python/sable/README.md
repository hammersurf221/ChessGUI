# SABLE Transformer Engine

This directory contains a Python-based chess engine powered by a transformer model. The actual weights file `sable_model.pth` should be placed here but is not tracked in the repository.

Run `engine.py` with the embedded Python interpreter to obtain best move predictions given a FEN string on stdin. Output follows the format `bestmove <uci_move>`.
